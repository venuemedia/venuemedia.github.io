                How Does It Work?
            </h3>

            <p>
                We install state of the art digital equipment, including  42” LCD screens in your premises - FREE!!!
            </p>

            <p>
                We prepare professional advertisements for local advertisers and feature them on your screen. We also include your own information and promotional material on the screen. However, there is no audio which would interfere with the normal activities in your premises.
            </p>
         
            <p>
                Your customers/patients get to see the advertisement on a regular cycle, all day.
            </p>

            <p>
                There is no need for anyone in your business to interact with the screen in your location – it switches itself on and off automatically.
            </p>

            <p>
                You receive a regular commission payment based on the revenues collected - this commission is sent to you on an annual basis after the screens are installed at your location.
